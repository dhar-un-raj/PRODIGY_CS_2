w# **Image Encryption and Decryption Tool**
## **Description**
This Python script provides a simple method to encrypt and decrypt images using basic pixel manipulation techniques. It swaps the red and blue channels of each pixel for encryption and reverses the process for decryption.

## **Features**
- Encryption: The image pixels are modified to create a "weird" visual effect.

- Decryption: The original image is restored by reversing the transformations applied during encryption

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.x

- Pillow library (pip install pillow)

## **Usage**
1. Clone the repository:

   `git clone https://github.com/dhar-un-raj/image-encryption-tool.git`

   `cd image-encryption-tool`

3. Encrypt an image:

   `python encrypt_image.py path_to_input_image.png path_to_output_encrypted_image.png`

5. Decrypt an image:

   `python decrypt_image.py path_to_input_encrypted_image.png path_to_output_decrypted_image.png`

## **Example**
### Encrypt an image:

`python encrypt_image.py path_to_your_image.png encrypted_image.png`

### Decrypt an image:
`python decrypt_image.py encrypted_image.png decrypted_image.png`

## **Notes**
- Replace path_to_your_image.png with the actual path to your image.

- Ensure you have permissions to read from the input directory and write to the output directory.

- This tool uses basic pixel manipulation techniques and is intended for educational purposes. For more secure encryption, consider using established cryptographic libraries.

Source data : knowledge 

As part of my responsibilities, I reviewed and validated the security policies deployed across EDR, Sophos, Netskope, and Cloudflare to ensure they aligned with organizational security standards. I actively monitored each platform's native console for High, Medium, and Low severity alerts, ensuring timely detection and escalation of potential threats. I focused on analyzing repeated incidents to identify patterns or configuration issues, and compiled a detailed incident analysis report. The document included root cause analysis, improvement recommendations, and key learnings to enhance future incident response and policy optimization.



Source data : customer 

I identified a critical vulnerability related to Iopex, along with the leakage of employee details on the dark web. In response, I conducted daily analysis of adversary tactics from websites aligned with our organization’s threat landscape to stay ahead of emerging threats. I proactively mitigated the vulnerabilities related to this exposure and strengthened our security measures. Additionally, I utilized tools like Qualys for vulnerability scanning and Meadows for adversary simulations, ensuring that our defenses are continuously tested and fortified against evolving threats.




Source data : skill


I have worked on SOC processes, analyzing use cases for triggered alerts and suggesting several fine-tunings to improve detection accuracy. I also implemented protection levels to enhance the overall security posture. In the NOC process, I troubleshot several incidents related to frontend and backend systems using Zabbix and OpMon. On a weekly basis, I conducted VLAN auditing and blocked unwanted and malicious URLs, reducing potential threats. I also addressed critical findings such as the Iopex vulnerability and employee data leakage in the SOC. To ensure the minimization of false positives, I fine-tuned detection rules and contributed to a more accurate and efficient threat detection system. By proactively addressing both high and low-severity incidents, I helped improve incident response quality and strengthened the security and operational processes.






Source data : process


As a Frontline Security Analyst, I consistently adhere to the company’s internal security policies and procedures to maintain discipline and ensure the integrity of our security measures. I follow all applicable guidelines for security tools and systems, ensuring that all actions, from incident handling to system monitoring, are in strict alignment with the company’s standards. By staying committed to these policies, I contribute to a structured and secure environment, promoting accountability and minimizing operational risks. My focus on compliance helps to maintain discipline within the premises and strengthens the overall security framework.
